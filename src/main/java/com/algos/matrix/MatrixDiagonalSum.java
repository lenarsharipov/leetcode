/**
 * Time Complexity
 * O(n): We traverse through each row of the matrix exactly once to get the elements
 * for our diagonal sums, where ( n ) is the number of rows (or columns, since
 * it's a square matrix). We do constant time work for each element (just addition and assignment). *
 *
 * Hence, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is ( O(n) ).
 *
 * Space Complexity
 * O(1): The space complexity is constant because we are using a fixed amount of additional space.
 * Our algorithm only uses two integer variables (length and totalSum) besides the input,
 * which doesnâ€™t grow with the size of the input matrix. Therefore, the amount of extra space
 * utilized doesn't scale with the size of the input.
 *
 * So, the overall space complexity of the algorithm is ( O(1) ).
